Chrome plugin for switching JavaScript on and off with a shortcut.

Note: chrome doesn't update 'no javascript' icon in url bar even
if JS is turned on with a shortcut. I don't know why.

* Alt-Shift-K: toggle JavaScript off/default for this domain

* Alt-Shift-J: toggle JavaScript on/default for this domain
